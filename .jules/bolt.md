## 2024-07-16 - Memoize List Items to Prevent Unnecessary Re-renders
**Learning:** When rendering a list of interactive components (like form inputs), any change to one item can cause the entire list to re-render, leading to significant performance degradation, especially in long lists. The correct pattern to solve this is to extract the list item into its own component and wrap it with `React.memo`. Crucially, any callback functions passed as props to this memoized component (e.g., `onUpdate`, `onRemove`) must be memoized in the parent component using `React.useCallback`. Without `useCallback`, the props would be seen as new on every render, defeating the purpose of `React.memo`.
**Action:** In the future, whenever I encounter a dynamic list where items can be updated, I will immediately check if the list items are memoized. This is a high-impact, low-risk optimization that I should prioritize.
