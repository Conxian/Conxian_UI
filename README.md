# Welcome to the Conxian UI

![Conxian UI Homepage](docs/images/homepage.png)

This is the official UI for interacting with Conxian contracts on the Stacks blockchain. Whether you're a casual user or a seasoned pro, we've got you covered with a single, unified interface.

## Our Signature Look: The Conxian Color Palette

Our "earthy corporate finance" theme is designed to be both professional and inviting:

* **Primary**: #2E403B (a deep, calming green)
* **Accent**: #D4A017 (a touch of sophisticated gold)
* **Neutrals**: #F5F5F5, #E0E0E0, #333333 (for a clean, modern look)
