## 2024-08-16 - Replace Disabled Buttons with Actionable Links

**Learning:** A disabled button for an unmet prerequisite (e.g., "Install Wallet") creates a dead-end for the user. It signals a problem without offering a solution. A more effective UX pattern is to provide an actionable element, such as a link, that directs the user to the solution. This transforms a point of friction into a helpful, guided step.

**Action:** When encountering a UI element that is disabled due to a missing dependency (like a required browser extension or account setup), I will replace it with a styled link to the appropriate resource. This maintains visual consistency while improving the user journey.
